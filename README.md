There exists a great game called ["The Box"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1181338950).

But there also exist [mods](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2004910016) created by the community.

The point of this table is to have a cool box table(who doesn't want to play "The Box" on a Box right?) and automate the
boring tasks(such as importing mods, counting dice etc.).

If you want to try it out in-game then go to
it's [workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2469748308).

I use my own libraries in this project so if you want to look at them then you can
go [here](https://github.com/PalaBeaveR/BeaverStash).

Current automations include:

- Roller
  - Counts the values on your rolled dice/coins

- Setup
  - A system that supports both the normal and alternate setups.
  - UI included

- Addon Importer
  - Nobody likes to do it themselves so now the box will do it for you.
  - To import an addon spawn it onto the box table, right-click it and press Import. You will see a list of addon items
    that you can choose to import or not.(useful if you don't want to use The Art Box or the alternate rules).
  - Only promoted players, and the host can use this.
