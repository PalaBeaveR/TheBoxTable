There exists a great game called ["The Box"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1181338950).

But there also exist [mods](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2004910016) created by the community.

The point of this table is to have a cool box table(who doesn't want to play "The Box" on a Box right?) and automate the
boring tasks(such as importing mods, counting dice etc.).

---

Current automations include:

- Roller
    - counts the values on your rolled dice/coins
    - protects the dice/coins you rolled from being rolled by other players
